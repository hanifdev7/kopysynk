    *   The login and signup pages now feature a modern, responsive design.
    *   The forms are presented in a centered, card-like container with a box shadow, providing a clean and focused user experience.
    *   The layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring usability on both mobile and desktop devices.
*   **Realtime User Data:** Upon successful signup, user information (username and email) is stored in the Firebase Realtime Database.
*   **Signup Success Page:** After successfully creating an account, the user is redirected to a confirmation page with a link to the login page. This provides clear feedback and a better user experience.
*   **Form Validation:** The login and signup forms have client-side validation to ensure that users enter valid data before submitting to Firebase.
*   **User Personalization:** The header of the website now greets logged-in users by their name, creating a more personal and welcoming experience.

    *   Users can add courses to their shopping cart from the courses page.
    *   A dedicated `cart.html` page displays all items in the cart.
    *   Users can remove items from the cart.
    *   The total price is dynamically calculated and displayed in Indian Rupees (â‚¹).
    *   The cart's state is persisted using the browser's local storage.

## Current Task

    *   Updated `login.html` to include the `cart-count` element in the header and ensure the form structure is consistent with the new styles.
    *   Updated the copyright year to 2024 in `login.html`.
